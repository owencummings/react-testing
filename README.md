# React Native & Redux Mobile Flashcards, an Udacity Project

A React SPA to store video game reviews. 

This was my first React App, so it is a little clunky. I went back to it later to test using the styled-components and page-transitions libraries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Simply fork the reposity and run 

```
npm install 
```

and then 

``` 
npm run 
```


## What I learned

Building a React app. Using styled-components and page-transitions to create a better user experience.

Styled-components are cool! They make it much easier to, say, change the child components when a parent is being acted on, which I like a lot.

Page Transitions are still a little rough. Think the community may still be a ways out from this. I could see it being better if we drop the DOM, but that won't be happening any time soon. There's a time and a place for this. 



## What could be improved

Nothing, serves its purpose.
